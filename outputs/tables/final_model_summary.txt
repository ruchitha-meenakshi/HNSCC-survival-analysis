MODEL COMPARISON SUMMARY
----------------------------
Cox Proportional Hazards: Concordance = 0.646
Random Forest (classification): AUC = 0.546
Logistic Regression (L1-regularized): AUC = 0.571
XGBoost: AUC = 0.557
Random Survival Forest (RSF): Concordance = 0.740
Penalized Cox (CoxNet): Concordance = 0.639

INTERPRETATION:
1. Binary classifiers (AUC ~0.55) performed poorly, likely due to class imbalance and loss of time-to-event information.
2. Random Survival Forests (C-index = 0.74) significantly outperformed all other models.
3. This confirms that modeling censorship is critical for accurate HNSCC prognosis.
