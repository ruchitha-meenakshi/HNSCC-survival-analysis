MODEL COMPARISON SUMMARY
----------------------------
Cox Proportional Hazards: Concordance = 0.646
Random Forest (classification): AUC = 0.546
Logistic Regression (L1-regularized): AUC = 0.571
XGBoost: AUC = 0.557
Random Survival Forest (RSF): Concordance = 0.740
Penalized Cox (CoxNet): Concordance = 0.639

INTERPRETATION:
Traditional classifiers showed modest performance, likely limited by the clinical variables available.
Random Survival Forests significantly outperformed other models (C-index = 0.74), 
demonstrating the value of native survival modeling for censored data.
Penalized Cox regression (CoxNet) also showed good performance (C-index = 0.639), 
reinforcing the value of regularization and stage-based risk stratification.
